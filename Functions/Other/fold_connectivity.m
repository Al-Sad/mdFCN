% Description:
% It fold the connecitivty values back to their square form with a supplied
% fidelty matrix.

function [yb, y] = fold_connectivity(x, mask, per)
per = 100*(1 - per);
y = zeros(size(mask));
y(mask) = x;
y(isnan(y)) = 0;
y = fold_upper_matrix(y);
yb = double(y >= prctile(nonzeros(y), per));
end
