% Description:
% It standardizes the connectivity patterns of every subject by removing
% their median and setting their median absolute deviation to one.

function T = tensor_correct_median(T)
[Nb, Ns, ~] = size(T);
for i = 1:Ns
    for j = 1:Nb
        temp = squeeze(T(j,i,:));
        if(sum(temp) > 0)
            T(j,i,:) = normalize(temp,'center','median','scale','mad');
        else
            T(j,i,:) = temp;
        end
    end
